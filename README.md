# DSCL-EXP-02
Short Description: This C program initializes an integer array varA with 5 elements and takes an input integer n from the user. If the value of n is less than or equal to 4, the program prints the corresponding element of the array varA at the index n. If n is greater than 4, the program prints a message asking the user to input a number less than or equal to 4.

Algorithm:

Initialize an integer array varA with 5 elements. Take an integer input n from the user. If n is less than or equal to 4, print the corresponding element of the array varA at the index n. If n is greater than 4, print a message asking the user to input a number less than or equal to 4. Exit the program. Output: If the user inputs a value less than or equal to 4, the program will print the corresponding element of the array varA. For example, if the user inputs 2, the program will print 15.

If the user inputs a value greater than 4, the program will print the message insert the number below or equal to 4.
